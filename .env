# Top Better Strategy Settings

# Betting strategy: 'max' (compete with whales) or 'median' (target top 3)
# - max: Targets the #1 highest bet (most aggressive, highest cost)
# - median: Targets the 3rd highest bet + buffer (competitive, puts you in top 1-5)
# - motherlode: Studies the past 20 motherlodes and tries to predict when the next one comes
BETTING_STRATEGY=max

# Whale multiplier - assume the top whale bets this many times more than average
# Example: If avg bet is 0.01 SOL and multiplier is 2.5, assume whale bets 0.025 SOL
# Higher values = more conservative (bigger bets), lower values = more aggressive (smaller bets)
WHALE_MULTIPLIER=2.5

# Buffer percentage - add this % on top of estimated whale bet to beat them
BUFFER_PERCENT=4

# Maximum SOL to bet per square (safety cap)
MAX_BET_PER_SQUARE=0.0001

# Minimum SOL to bet per square (floor)
MIN_BET_PER_SQUARE=0.0001

# Note: Player counts are read from on-chain data - we estimate whale behavior

# Bot Behavior
# Poll interval in milliseconds (check every 2s for accurate sniping timing)
POLL_INTERVAL_MS=50

# Snipe window - deploy this many seconds BEFORE round ends
# This ensures you see all competition and nobody can react to your bet
# Lower = more aggressive (but riskier if tx is slow), higher = safer
SNIPE_WINDOW_SECONDS=10

# Claim rewards every round (true/false)
CLAIM_EVERY_ROUND=true

# Minimum claimable SOL before claiming (avoid wasting fees on tiny claims)
MIN_CLAIMABLE_SOL=0.1

# ORE Token Configuration

# ORE Claiming & Auto-Swap Settings
# Minimum ORE to claim (default: 0.5 ORE)

# Auto-swap claimed ORE to SOL via DFlow (default: true)

# Minimum ORE balance to trigger swap (default: 0.5 ORE)
MIN_ORE_FOR_SWAP=0.1

# Safety Settings
# Keep this much SOL in wallet for transaction fees
MIN_WALLET_BALANCE=0.0001

# Dry run mode - simulate without actually sending transactions (true/false)
